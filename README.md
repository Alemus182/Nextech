# NextTech Demo v 1.0

Baseline for construction of an API based on .net 7, under the proposed clean architecture approaches and the use of SOLID development principles.
As well as a single page application base in angular like a front end.

# Technology Stack
## Backend
    - .net 7
    - Minimal Apis
    - FluentValidation
    - Mediator
    - NLog
    - JWT Bearer token `autentication`
## Frontend
    - Angular 10
    - Angular Material
    - Boostrap
    - RxJs
# Assumptions
- The application uses InMemoryCache and it is refreshed every hour
- Authentication is based on username and password and it generates a JWT.
  The only validation that is carried out is that it is a valid email and
  that the password has more than 8 characters.
# Execution
## Backend
   - Do you need Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio
   - Download the .net 7 SDK available in [Web Site](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/es-es/download/dotnet/7.0)
   - Navigate to the folder "Api" and run:
       ```properties
       dotnet run
       ```
    - It Will be open in: https://localhost:7245
    - For execute the test suite, go to  the folder "Test" and run:
         ```properties
       dotnet test
      ```   
 ## Frontend
 -   Do you need Visual Studio Code
 -   The current Application is in Angular 10, if you have a higher versi√≥n of node.js   12.11.1, Do you need to use NVM (Node Version Manager) for Windows? You can download it at: [Website](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation--upgrades) or download it through a 
 package manager like chocolatey. for Windows or Homebrew for mac.
 - After installation of NVM, do you need to install the node version
      ```properties
       nvm install 12.11.1
       nvm use 12.11.1
    ```
 - Navigate to the folder 'Web', and run:
	```properties
	  npm run ng serve
	``` 
      It Will be open in: http://localhost:4200/
